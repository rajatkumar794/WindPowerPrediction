# Wind Power Output Forecast

A time series forecasting model that would generate point forecasts of wind generation for the upcoming three days, for a wind turbine in Turkey. I have used publicly available historical weather data of a wind plant to train model and learn the changing weather patterns. I have used a VAR (Vector Autoregressive) model, a multivariate time-series model to handle multiple time series of different weather attributes.
